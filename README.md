# Portofolio_with_tailwind
Try to something new
In this repository, I try to make Portofolio using Tailwind CSS. I know my code still confused to see because I also thing that. But, I'm still focus to make my code make result page that I wish. This is make a little bit long time because I also try to combinate it with Repsonsive design. 
This is inspirated by Mr. Sandhika Galih Yt : WPU
